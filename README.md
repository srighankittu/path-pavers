In the challenging landscape of the current job market, recent graduates, especially those from international backgrounds, often find themselves in a precarious position. Recognizing this issue, we developed GradGrove, an innovative application designed to connect MS graduates in Computer Science with volunteer opportunities that not only enhance their skills but also keep them engaged and compliant with immigration regulations.

GradGrove is an initiative aimed at providing practical, real-world experience to budding software developers. This project marked my debut in a hackathon-style competition among peers, where the fusion of creativity, technology, and a pressing need for graduate support culminated in the creation of GradGrove.

GradGrove acts as a bridge between recent graduates and professors willing to supervise volunteer projects. Through a user-friendly interface, graduates can register, find volunteer tasks aligned with their skills, and commit to 21 hours of weekly work under the guidance of a mentor. The application emphasizes accountability and growth, requiring weekly progress reports to ensure both the development of the graduate and the fulfillment of volunteer commitments.
